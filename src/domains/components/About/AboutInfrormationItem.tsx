      <p className={styles.description}>
        Hi there, Iâ€™m Anastasiiaâ€”a product designer with a finance background, passionate about using design to enhance peopleâ€™s lives.
      </p>

      <p className={styles.description}>
        My journey began with a love for graphic design, inspired by my husbandâ€™s engineering enthusiasm. From the moment I started, I was hooked. I found myself waking up at 5 AM just to dive back into my projectsâ€”I couldnâ€™t get enough. As I continued to explore design, I became captivated by the challenge of solving complex problems and creating intuitive, user-friendly solutions.
      </p>

      <p className={styles.description}>
        With over six years of experience in UX/UI design, I specialize in transforming intricate ideas into clear, enjoyable user experiences. My goal is always to design with a human touch, ensuring that every project I work on makes a positive difference in peopleâ€™s lives.
